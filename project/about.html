            Technology has become ubiquitous with daily life. There are so many different kinds of technology that perform different tasks and services that most of them have little to nothing in common. However there is one thing that you will find in any piece of technology regardless of its contents or deliverables, which is that it breaks. Let’s face it technology in this day and age is made to break, malfunction, and falter within a short period of time so you will be tempted to buy the next “big thing” on the market. Now while most companies provide warranties for replacement and repair everything seems to go bad 3 days after that expires, so what then? You can try to take it back to the store you bought it in which most of the time only results in frustration and the muttering of the line, “I’ll never shop here again!” Or if you’re the adventurous type you can travel far and wide to look for an independent repair shop which only seems to deal with computer related issues. Instead of going through all of this pain, anger, and torment why not just let the repair come to you with our new app for IT support FixIT.
